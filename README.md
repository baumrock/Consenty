# Consenty

Welcome to Consenty, a sleek and straightforward vanilla JavaScript library designed to simplify consent management on your website. Whether you're looking to embed YouTube videos, use cookies, or manage any other type of user consent, Consenty has got you covered.

## Why Consenty?

Ever found yourself thinking, "All I want to do is embed a YouTube video on my site. How hard can it be?" Well, in the EU and many other places, you're required to obtain user consent before loading external assets like YouTube videos. This is where Consenty shines! It offers a lightweight, easy-to-implement solution for managing user consents without the need for bulky consent management platforms or annoying cookie banners.

Building your own consent management tool might seem daunting, but with Consenty, it's a breeze. We handle the nitty-gritty details, such as interfacing with local storage and ensuring users can easily revoke their permissions at any time.

For a deep dive into how to implement and use Consenty, check out our comprehensive documentation at [baumrock.github.io/Consenty](https://baumrock.github.io/Consenty).
